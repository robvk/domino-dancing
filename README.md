# Domino Dancing

This Domino Game simulation algorithm and TypeScript implementation is designed and written by me. Yes, I decided to reinvent the wheel.

This short program is a graduate project from JavaScript course by [HackYourFuture, Amsterdam](https://www.hackyourfuture.net/).

The technical assignment for the simulation is here: [technical assignment](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/post-grad-ed/blob/master/technical-assignments/w1-w2/JS-DominoGame.pdf)

Here is the [working copy of the simulation](https://shenshin.github.io/domino-dancing/).
