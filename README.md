# Domino Dancing

Here is the [working copy of the interactive version and the simulation](https://shenshin.github.io/domino-dancing/).

This Domino Game simulation algorithm and TypeScript implementation is designed and written by me. Yes, I decided to reinvent the wheel.

This program is inspired by a JavaScript course by [HackYourFuture, Amsterdam](https://www.hackyourfuture.net/).

The technical assignment for the simulation is here:

The TypeScript source code is located in [src](https://github.com/shenshin/domino-dancing/tree/master/src) folder of this repository. TypeScript config file [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/shenshin/domino-dancing/blob/master/tsconfig.json), ESLint config file [.eslintrc.json](.eslintrc.json), NPM configuration [package.json](https://github.com/shenshin/domino-dancing/blob/master/package.json) as well as a couple of more config files used to create and build this game can all be found in the root of this repository. Feel free to clone it and play with the code if you want.
